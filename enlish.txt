last month i went to the concert with my friend. 
and we had crazy moment with it.
in the middle of concert when the band had something crazy, 
i saw someone from the crowd got on the stage and jump out from there,
and he broke his leg.

after concert i went go  warmindo to ate some food, i ordered "ayam geprek", 
i waited in few time with scrolling tiktok, and i found a new idea for 
eating another food, the food is "chicken noodle" 

so i tell the cashier that i want to switch my order. The cashier told me 
that my Ayam Geprek was already done. So i decided to add new order because i felt
uneasy with the cashier. 

And that is my story when i went to concert twith my friend..
